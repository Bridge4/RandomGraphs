    Want to make a maze game
    I do not know where to start
    Goals:
        - Generate a Maze using different algorithms such as Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's
        - Solve it with depth-first and breadth-first search
    Problems:
        - What the fuck how do I even start this
        - Do I use 2D arrays? Do I generate an image file? Do I use notepad and unicode chars?
        - The prettiest would be an image file
